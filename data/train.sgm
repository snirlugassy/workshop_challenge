<TITLE>U.S. HOUSE CALLS HIGHER JAPAN DEFENSE SPENDING</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, June 18 - </DATELINE><BODY>The House today supported a call for
Japan to boost its defense spending to help share the burden of
protecting Western interests in sensitive areas around the
world, including in the Gulf.
    House member approved a measure that would require
Secretary of State George Shultz to enter into talks with Japan
on increasing Japanese defense spending to at least 3 pct of
its gross national product.
    The measure, passed during consideration of the 1988-89
State Department funding bill would not require an increase,
but legislators called on Japan to spend more on defense. The
Senate must approve the measure before it becomes law.
    "We don't have to bash the Japanese. We have to show them
how to share the burden of the defense of the free world," said
Rep. Robert Dornan, a California Republican.
    The amendment calls on Shultz to enter into talks with
Japan with the aim of reaching agreement on one of two
alternatives: either Japan can spend 3 pct of its GNP on
defense by itself or give the equivalent amount of money to the
United States as a kind of security fee.

<TITLE>AUSTRALIA SET TO GROW, BUT UNEMPLOYMENT MAY RISE</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    PARIS, June 19 - </DATELINE><BODY>Australia's economy should manage modest
growth over the next two years after a sharp slowdown but
unemployment could still edge upwards, the Organisation for
Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) said.
    The organisation's latest half-yearly report says Gross
Domestic Product will grow by 2.5 pct this year and by 2.75 pct
in 1988 compared with only 1.4 pct in 1986. The growth will be
helped by higher stockbuilding and stronger domestic demand
following tax cuts and higher real wages, it added.
    The report forecasts a decline in inflation, with consumer
prices increasing by 8.5 pct this year and 6.25 pct in 1988.
    The current account deficit shows signs of easing slightly
and could narrow to 12 billion dlrs by the end of 1988.
    While predicting slightly stronger growth than last year,
however, the report revises downwards the OECD's earlier growth
forecast for 1987 of 3.75 pct.
    The OECD predicts a similar combination of modest economic
growth and rising unemployment for New Zealand, which is
struggling to recover from a major economic crisis.
    The country's GDP, which contracted by 0.6 pct last year,
should again show growth over the next two years, rising by
0.25 pct this year and a more substantial 2.75 pct in 1988.

<TITLE>SQUIBB &lt;SQB> SAID NOT INTERESTED IN BUYING CETUS</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    BY MARJORIE SHAFFER, REUTERS</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    NEW YORK, June 18 - </DATELINE><BODY>Robert Fildes, president and chief
executive of Cetus Corp &lt;CTUS.O>, told Reuters that Squibb Corp
is not interested in buying Cetus.
    Earlier the companies said Squibb would buy from Cetus a
five pct equity postion in Cetus for about 40 mln dlrs.
    "This is not an attempt by Squibb to become a major
majority holder in Cetus," Fildes told Reuters in an interview.
"Squibb has not approached us with any indication that they
want to acquire us and we wouldn't be interested in that kind
of arrangement," said Fildes.
    Squibb could not be reached to comment on the late comments
by Fildes.
    Squibb is Cetus' first pharmaceutical partner and the only
one to own an equity position in Cetus. Eastman Kodak Co &lt;EK>
and W.R. Grace &lt;WR> both have joint ventures with Cetus, but
neither owns an equity position in the company, said Fildes.
    Cetus has a venture with Kodak to develp diagnostic
products and with Grace to develop agricultural products.
    Earlier, Squibb and Cetus announced in a joint statement
an agreement in principle to form a joint venture to develop
new biotechnology products in several fields.

    As part of the deal Squibb will license several of Cetus'
anticancer agents, including interleukin-2, in development.
Squibb will sell the drugs only in Japan and other markets but
not in North American and Western Europe.
    "We wouldn't have done this deal had it not been understood
that Cetus wants to build its own fully integrated business in
North America and Europe," said Fildes.
    He said Squibb was the good partner because Squibb has a
major joint venture in Japan and has sales capabilities of its
own in that market.

    Fildes said Cetus has shunned licensing arrangements with
pharmaceutical companies because it wanted to build its own
business. Many large corporations have invested in small
biotech firms.
    But Squibb's investment in Cetus is the first it has made
in biotechnology. Fildes said that was attractive to Cetus
because it wanted a partner that didn't have a relationship
with a large number of other biotechnology companies."

    Fildes said his strategy was to have partners in non drug
areas like diagnostics and agriculture, but to "keep the
biggest developments in anticancer drugs to ourselves."
    Fildes said the partnership with Squibb would be used to
broaden the company's reach in such big money making areas
as the cardiovascular, anti-infective and the anti-inflammatory
markets.
    Squibb is also investming 75 mln dlrs in Cetus' research
over the next five years.

    "Squibb is putting up over 75 mln dlrs in research and
development to make it happen, while the equity position part
of the package is simply to demonstrate the seriousness of this
partnership," said Fildes.

<DATELINE>    NEW YORK, June 18 - </DATELINE><BODY>Mark Stahl, 45, who was a former senior
vice president of Shearson Lehman Brothers, until his
suspension on April 16, today admitted in U.S. District court
here, embezzling almost 19 mln dlrs from his firm over the past
year.
    He entered a guilty plea before United States District
Court Judge Vincent Broderick to four specific charges totaling
1,031,000 dlrs on wire fraud.
    Stahl, who was a senior vice president for finance, told
the judge that the total embezzlement amounted to "a little
less than" 19 mln dlrs.

    Through an attorney, Stahl agreed to make restitution to
Shearson Lehman of all the embezzled funds if possible. However
his guilty pleas today to the four counts will cover all
criminal liability of the embezzlement that occurred between
April 1986 to last April.
    Judge Broderick scheduled sentencing for December nine.
    Stahl faces a maximum sentence of 20 years in jail and one
mln dlrs in fines, or both.

<TITLE>CANADA TO INCREASE CORPORATE TAX REVENUES</TITLE>
<DATELINE>     OTTAWA, June 18 - </DATELINE><BODY>Canada will increase corporate tax
revenues by about five billion dlrs over the next five years by
broadening the tax base and allowing fewer exemptions, finance
minister Michael Wilson said.
     As Wilson previously promised, he said corporations will
bear an increased tax burden, despite new measures to lower
overall tax rates.
     Increased corporate revenues will result from broadening
the tax base and eliminating special tax exemptions.
     "The jobs of many Canadians depend on a corporate income
tax system that is competitive with other countries,
particularly the United States," Wilson said in a prepared
speech to the House of Commons.
     "And it (tax reform) will ensure that profitable
corporations carry a bigger share of the total tax burden," he
added.
     Federal tax revenue from corporations will increase by 470
mln dlrs in the fiscal year ending March 31, 1988, 410 mln dlrs
in fiscal 1989 and 1.19 billion dlrs in fiscal 1990, according
to documents tabled with Wilson's speech.

<TITLE>CANADA FINANCIAL TAX RATE INCREASED</TITLE>
<DATELINE>     OTTAWA, June 18 - </DATELINE><BODY>The average tax rate for Canadian
financial insitutions will increase to 21.3 pct from 14.5 pct
under the new tax reform package, the federal finance
department said.
     The amount of financial institutions' income that is taxed
will also increase to 74.0 pct from 48.7 pct, it said in
documents tabled with finance minister Michael Wilson's
prepared speech to the House of Commons.
     Under Wilson's plan, the federal government will collect
1.36 billion dlrs more over the next five years from financial
insitutions, including banks, trust mortgage and life insurance
companies, according to finance department documents.
     Financial institutions "are going to complain, but we
believe the changes are appropriate and affordable," said one
finance department official who asked not to be identified.
     Ottawa will collect more revenue from financial
institutions by reducing the amount of reserves they can deduct
from taxes, which "will broaden the tax base for this low tax
paying sector," the finance department said.
     Among the changes, chartered banks will no longer be able
to use a five-year averaging formula to calculate loan losses
that may be deducted for tax purposes.
     Effective June 17, 1987, banks will deduct bad or doubtful
loans during the year they are incurred.
     The finance department said the impact of the new
provisions will be cushioned over a period of five years.
     The changes are needed to ensure that all financial
companies are taxed fairly under deregulation of the financial
services industry.
     "It would be inconsistent for the tax system to continue
to provide different reserves for tax purposes for institutions
competing in the same marketplace," the finance department
said.

<TEXT>&#2;
<TITLE>OTTAWA WIDENS SALES TAX, STUDIES REPLACEMENT</TITLE>
<DATELINE>     OTTAWA, June 18 - </DATELINE><BODY>Canada will broaden a federal sales tax
levied on manufacturers before scrapping the system in favor of
a broad based, multi-staged sales tax, finance minister Michael
Wilson said.
     As expected, Wilson did not include a new sales tax system
as part of his wide-ranging tax reforms tabled in the House of
Commons today.
    Instead, the federal government will make interim changes
to the existing sales tax to make it more fair for low and
middle income Canadians.
    "The present (sales) tax is fundamentally flawed. It is a
hidden, arbitrary and capricious tax," Wilson told the House of
Commons.
    The existing federal sales tax system hurts the Canadian
economy by putting more tax on Canadian produced goods than
imported goods and adding a hidden tax on Canadian exports that
makes them less competitive, Wilson said.
     Interim changes effective January 1, 1988 will include:
     -- applying the federal sales tax to marketing companies
related to manufacturers
     -- levying the tax at the wholesale level instead of the
manufacturer for a selected range of products
     -- applying a 10 pct sales tax to telecommunication
services, except for residential telephone lines
     -- quicker collection of federal sales taxes.
     To offset these changes for low income Canadians,
refundable tax credits will be increased to 70 dlrs from 50
dlrs for adults and to 35 dlrs from 25 dlrs for children, the
finance department said.
     Ottawa is considering three alternative forms for a new
sales tax, including a goods and services tax, a value added
tax and a national sales tax that would combine existing
federal and provincial levies into one system, Wilson told the
House of Commons.
     He said the federal government will explore the
possibility of one national sales tax with Canada's 10
provincial governments. All provinces except Albeta now levy a
provincial sales of tax of varying amounts.
     Wilson said one joint system would be simpler for
taxpayers and maximize economic benefits of tax reform.
     If Ottawa and the provinces can't agree on a national
sales tax system, Wilson said the federal government will
consider either a goods and services tax or a value-added tax.
     A goods and services tax would apply at one rate to
virtually all goods and services in Canada and would include
further increases in refundable tax credits for low and middle
income Canadians, the finance department said in documents
accompanying Wilson's speech.
     A federal value-added tax, similar to European tax
systems, would also be broad based but would allow more
flexibility to exempt selected goods and services, the
department said. The finance deparment said the main drawback
of a value added tax is that it would be more complex and
costly to implement than the other two proposals.

<TITLE>FALL IN CANADIAN BUDGET DEFICIT TO SLOW</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    OTTAWA, June 18 - </DATELINE><BODY>Finance Minister Michael Wilson said tax
reform will not affect his determination to reign in
expenditures, but his forecasts show a slowing of the decline
in the budget deficit in the late 1980s.
    "Responsible tax reform must be fiscally responsible,"
Wilson said in a speech prepared for the House of Commons.
    Wilson estimated the deficit will fall to 29.3 billion dlrs
in the year ending March 31, 1988, the same level as he
forecast in the February budget.
    And in the year ended this past March, the deficit was
expected to have been one billion dlrs lower than the 32
billion dlr shortfall originally forecast, Wilson said.
    Wilson said in the current 1988 fiscal year
higher-than-anticipated spending, particularly in farm income
support programs, will be offset by higher-than-anticipated
revenues.
    But finance department documents show the pace of deficit
reduction was expected to slow temporarily in fiscal 1989 and
1990 as a result of lower oil and grain prices and the
transition to the reformed taxation system.
    The deficit is expected to total 28.9 billion dlrs in
fiscal 1989 and 28.6 billion dlrs in 1989 and then fall to 26.1
billion dlrs in 1991.
    Wilson was optimistic about the outlook for the Canadian
economy, forcasting gross domestic product would expand 2.8 pct
this year and 3.0 pct in 1988. In 1986 the economy grew by an
actual 3.1 pct.
    Inflation, meanwhile, is expected to stabilize at around
the current four pct level over the next two years.

<TITLE>CANADA'S WILSON SETS NEW PREFERRED SHARE TAX</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    OTTAWA, June 18 - </DATELINE><BODY>Finance Minister Michael Wilson tabled a
ways and means motion to immediately impose a special tax on
preferred share dividends to eliminate a significant loss of
corporate tax revenue.
    Under the motion, which is used to introduce most financial
tax changes, dividends on all preferred shares issued after
June 18 will be taxable.
    The issuing corporation will be able to choose between two
forms of tax, one that imposes a 25 pct tax on dividends with a
subsequent additional 10 pct tax paid by the shareholder, and
one that imposes a flat 40 pct tax on dividends.
    "Measures to reduce the tax advantages of after-tax
financing arrangements using preferred shares are a critical
step in achieving the broadened corporate tax base required to
fund personal income tax reductions," Wilson explained.
    The minister said many profitable corporations, using
various deductions built up over the years, pay no taxes,
although they are in a position to pay dividends out of their
profits.

<TITLE>CANADA SETS WIDE-RANGING PERSONAL TAX CHANGES</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    OTTAWA, June 18 - </DATELINE><BODY>Finance Minister Michael Wilson unveiled
a wide-ranging reform of the personal tax system that includes
limiting the capital gains exemption and a sharp cut in the
dividend tax credit.
    With most changes effective at the first of next year,
Wilson also announced he was cutting the number of tax brackets
from 10 to three.
    He said the changes will cut personal tax revenues by two
billion dlrs in 1988 and by more than 11 billion dlrs over the
next five years.
    "Most Canadians will pay lower taxes because of two
far-reaching changes. A new structure of federal income tax
rates and the conversion of exemptions and deductions to tax
credits," Wilson told the House of Commons.
    The new tax brackets will be 17 pct on the first 27,500
dlrs of taxable income, 26 pct on the next 27,500 dlrs and 29
pct on taxable income in excess of 55,000 dlrs. The maximum tax
rate is 34 pct under the current system.
    In a major reversal of his own initiative, Wilson said the
controversial 500,000 dlrs capital gains exemption will be
reduced to 100,000 dlrs over an investors' lifetime.
    Wilson introduced the exemption shortly after taking office
in 1984 as a a way of stimulating investment, but it was
sharply criticized by the opposition as over-generous to
wealthy investors.
    The 500,000 dlr lifetime exemption  will be kept on the
sale of farm land and for small businesess, however.
    Also, the taxable portion of a capital gain will increase
from 50 pct currently to 66-2/3 pct in 1988 and 75 pct in 1990.
    The dividend tax credit will be reduced from 33-1/3 pct to
25 pct and the deduction for up to 1,000 dlrs of interest and
dividend income will be eliminated in 1988.
    Wilson said tax treatment for registered retirement savings
plan contributions will be maintained but the phase in of the
increase in the maximum limit to 15,500 dlrs will be delayed
four years to 1994.

<DATELINE>    NEW DELHI, June 19 - </DATELINE><BODY>Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi's Congress
(I) party was swept from power in the northern state of Haryana
by an opposition landslide.
    The loss was a major personal setback for Gandhi whose
vote-winning ability was on trial after political scandals in
Delhi and a string of electoral losses since he took command of
the party in 1984.
    With 53 results in for Haryana's 90-seat assembly, Congress
had won only two seats against 63 previously. Before the poll,
Congress politicians in Delhi said privately that a loss in
Haryana could open a party leadership debate.

<TITLE>COURT ORDERS INT'L MEDICAL INSURER TO SHOW CAUSE</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    TALLAHASSEE, Fla., June 18 - </DATELINE><BODY>A Circuit Court judge ordered
the company that insured the solvency of International Medical
Centres Inc to show cause why it should not honour its contract
with International, according to Florida's Department of
Insurance, which had filed a petition on the matter.
    As previously reported, International, the largest health
maintenance organisation in Florida was declared insolvent on
May 14. Federal regulators had also told the company its
Medicare contract would be terminated on July 31 because of the
company's financial and management problems.
    Michelle McLawhorn, Florida Department spokeswoman, said
International's insurer, State Mutual Life Assurance Co of
America, had made clear it would fight activation of the policy
because International did not provide it with accurate
financial records. State Mutual could not be reached for
comment.
    McLawhorn said it was not yet known how many creditors
International had or how big its debt was. The court gave State
Mutual 20 days to show why it should not be obliged to pay
claims against the solvency policy.

    Although the country's constitution allows for a six-year

    The Constituent Assembly is drawing up a new constitution

<TITLE>FED DATA SUGGEST NO CHANGE IN MONETARY POLICY</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Kathleen Hays, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    NEW YORK, June 18 - </DATELINE><BODY>New U.S. Banking data suggest the
Federal Reserve is guiding monetary policy along a steady path
and is not signalling any imminent change of course, economists
said.
    But they also said that if money supply growth remains
weak, as this week's unexpected eight billion dlr M-1 decline
suggests it may, this could influence the Fed to loosen its
credit reins and move toward a more accommodative monetary
policy.
    A Reuter survey of 17 money market economists produced a
forecast of a 600 mln dlr M-1 decline for the week ended June
8, with estimates ranging from a gain of one billion dlrs to a
decline of four billion. Instead, M-1 fell eight billion dlrs
to 745.7 billion dlrs at a seasonally adjusted annual rate.
    Coming on the heels of a 4.3 billion decrease in M-1 for
the week ended June 1, this means the nation's money supply has
fallen more than 12 billion dlrs in the past two weeks,
economists said.
    "M-1 has hit an air pocket of weakness," said Bill Sullivan
of Dean Witter Reynolds Inc.
    While M-1 may have lost its significance as an indicator of
economic growth, Sullivan said Fed officials might be concerned
the latest drop in M-1 means another month of sluggish growth
in the broader monetary aggregates, M-2 and M-3, which are seen
as better gauges of economic growth.
    Latest monthly M-2 and M-3 data showed that as of May, both
measures were growing at rates below the bottom of the Fed's
5-1/2 to 8-1/2 pct target ranges.
    If money growth does not accelerate, Fed officials,
concerned that this indicates economic growth is flagging,
could turn toward easier monetary policy, economists said.
    "Does this mean that the Fed abandons its current open
market position? No," Sullivan said. "But does this mean the end
of tightening for the time being? Definitely yes."
    Economists said average adjusted discount window borrowings
of 385 mln dlrs for the latest two-week bank statement period
were lower than they had expected. Most believed the Fed had
targetted a two-week borrowings average of around 500 mln dlrs.
    But they said that if it had not been for a large one-day
net miss in the Fed's reserve projections, the higher
borrowings target would probably have been reached.
    A drop in May U.S. Housing starts and continued weakness in
auto sales show key sectors of the U.S. Economy are lagging,
while a recent modest 0.3 pct gain in May producer prices has
helped dispel inflation fears, Slifer said.
    "If this continues, we can entertain the notion of Fed
easing at some point," he said.
    Other economists said the Fed would probably pay little
attention to weak money supply growth. "It has been a number of
years since M-1 has given good signs of what's going on in the
economy," one said. "I don't think M-1 shows that the economy is
falling apart and the Fed should ease."
    Economists agreed a stable dollar will continue to be a
prerequisite for any move by the Fed toward easier monetary
policy.
    They said the Fed is reluctant to lower short-term rates
for fear this would spur expectations of a weaker dollar and
higher inflation which would push up long-term yields and choke
off econmomic growth.
    But Sullivan said the dollar has been steady since late
April. "The Fed has to determine if this represents a
fundamental change for the dollar. If it does, then this gives
them more room to ease," he said.
